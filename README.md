### What does the fox see?

---
Sionnach Scenes, Silliness and Sundries is a combination of Sionnach Scenes and Sionnach Silliness and Sundries. 

#### Sionnach Scenes  

Sionnach Scenes is a story prompt site where users can add to the original story prompt and users can take turns telling the story in the same thread, or start a new thread that continues from the same original prompt and take turns telling a new version. 

#### Sionnach Silliness and Sundries 

Sionnach Silliness and Sundries is a satirical store jokingly selling things that either don’t really exist, or at least not in a way they can be packaged and sold. Many of the products are based on old jokes or puns.

This store is for a project for school and won’t actually charge customers for it’s fictitious merchandise.
